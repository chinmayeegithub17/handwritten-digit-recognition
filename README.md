# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN 

This is my **first AI project** where I built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize handwritten digits using the famous **MNIST dataset**.  
The project is built using **TensorFlow**, **Matplotlib**, and **Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## What the Project Does:
- Loads the **MNIST dataset** (images of handwritten digits 0–9).
- Preprocesses the data (normalization & reshaping).
- Builds a **CNN model** to classify digits.
- Trains the model on the dataset.
- Tests the model on unseen images.
- Makes predictions and visualizes the results.

---

## Technologies Used:
- Python 3.12
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Accuracy & Limitations:
- The model achieves decent accuracy but may misclassify some digits, especially those written in confusing handwriting.
- Future improvements could include more training epochs or a deeper CNN architecture.

---

## How to Run:
1. Install Python and the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

python -m notebook
Open the .ipynb file and run the code step by step.

* Special Note *
This is my beginner AI project—it’s not perfect, but it's a major step in my learning journey in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
